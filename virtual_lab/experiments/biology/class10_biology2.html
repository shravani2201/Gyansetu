        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate the process of osmosis in potato cells and observe the movement of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Potato</li>
            <li>Water</li>
            <li>Concentrated sugar solution</li>
            <li>Knife</li>
            <li>Spoon</li>
            <li>Beaker (2)</li>
            <li>Measuring scale (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut a potato into two equal halves. Carve a small hollow cavity in the center of each half using a knife or spoon.</li>
            <li>Label the two beakers as *A* and *B*. Fill beaker A with plain water and beaker B with a concentrated sugar solution.</li>
            <li>Place one potato half in each beaker, ensuring the cavity faces upwards.</li>
            <li>Add water to the cavity of the potato in beaker A and sugar solution to the cavity of the potato in beaker B.</li>
            <li>Leave the setup undisturbed for 3-4 hours and observe the changes in the level of liquid in the cavities and the size of the potato halves.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>
            After a few hours:
            <ul>
                <li>The cavity in the potato placed in water (beaker A) remains the same or may fill slightly due to water entering the cells.</li>
                <li>The cavity in the potato placed in sugar solution (beaker B) shows a reduction in liquid as water moves out of the potato cells into the sugar solution.</li>
                <li>The potato in beaker B shrinks slightly due to the loss of water, while the one in beaker A appears firm and turgid.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Inference</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment demonstrates the process of osmosis:
            <ul>
                <li>Osmosis is the movement of water molecules from a region of higher water concentration to a region of lower water concentration through a semi-permeable membrane.</li>
                <li>In beaker A, water enters the potato cells due to osmosis, making them turgid.</li>
                <li>In beaker B, water leaves the potato cells into the sugar solution, causing the potato to shrink (plasmolysis).</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the potato slices are of similar size to observe clear differences in the results.</li>
            <li>Handle the knife carefully to avoid injury while carving the potato.</li>
            <li>Use fresh and clean water to avoid contamination affecting the results.</li>
            <li>Leave the setup undisturbed during the experiment for accurate observations.</li>
        </ul>
