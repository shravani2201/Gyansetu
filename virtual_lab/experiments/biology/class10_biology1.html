        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate the process of photosynthesis in plants and test the presence of starch in a leaf.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beaker</li>
            <li>Test tube</li>
            <li>Leaf from a potted plant kept in sunlight</li>
            <li>Boiling water</li>
            <li>Alcohol (ethanol)</li>
            <li>Water bath (to safely heat ethanol)</li>
            <li>Iodine solution</li>
            <li>Forceps</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Select a leaf from a potted plant that has been exposed to sunlight for several hours.</li>
            <li>Boil the leaf in water for 2-3 minutes using a beaker. This softens the leaf and kills it, stopping all metabolic processes.</li>
            <li>Using forceps, transfer the boiled leaf into a test tube containing ethanol. Place the test tube in a water bath and heat it until the leaf becomes decolorized (removal of chlorophyll).</li>
            <li>Remove the leaf carefully and rinse it in cold water to soften it and make it more pliable.</li>
            <li>Place the leaf on a white tile and add a few drops of iodine solution to it. Observe the color change.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>
            The part of the leaf exposed to sunlight turns blue-black after adding iodine solution, indicating the presence of starch. 
            Any part of the leaf that was not exposed to sunlight remains yellow-brown, showing the absence of starch.
        </p>

        <h2>Inference</h2>
        <p>
            This experiment demonstrates that:
            <ul>
                <li>Photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight, leading to the production of starch as a byproduct.</li>
                <li>Chlorophyll is essential for photosynthesis, as it traps sunlight needed for the process.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the potted plant is exposed to sunlight for sufficient time (at least 4-6 hours) before performing the experiment.</li>
            <li>Handle ethanol with care as it is flammable. Always use a water bath for heating ethanol.</li>
            <li>Use forceps to handle the hot leaf to avoid burns.</li>
            <li>Rinse the leaf thoroughly after boiling in ethanol to remove traces of alcohol that might interfere with the iodine test.</li>
        </ul>
