        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To study the structure and function of the human respiratory system and demonstrate the mechanism of breathing.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3D model or diagram of the human respiratory system</li>
            <li>Balloon</li>
            <li>Plastic bottle (empty)</li>
            <li>Rubber sheet or glove</li>
            <li>Scissors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Study the Respiratory System:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Observe a model or diagram of the human respiratory system.</li>
                    <li>Identify the trachea, bronchi, lungs, alveoli, and diaphragm.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Demonstrate Breathing Movements:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cut the bottom of a plastic bottle to create an open base.</li>
                    <li>Insert a balloon into the neck of the bottle, ensuring it is secured tightly with a rubber band.</li>
                    <li>Cover the open base of the bottle with a rubber sheet or glove to act as the diaphragm. Fix it tightly using a rubber band.</li>
                    <li>Pull the rubber sheet downwards gently to simulate inhalation. The balloon inside will expand, showing the lungs filling with air.</li>
                    <li>Push the rubber sheet upwards gently to simulate exhalation. The balloon will deflate, showing the lungs expelling air.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>
            During the experiment, the following observations are made:
            <ul>
                <li>When the rubber sheet (diaphragm) is pulled down, the balloon (lungs) expands as air enters, simulating inhalation.</li>
                <li>When the rubber sheet is pushed up, the balloon deflates as air is expelled, simulating exhalation.</li>
                <li>This demonstrates the role of the diaphragm in breathing by creating a pressure gradient for air movement in and out of the lungs.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Inference</h2>
        <p>
            The respiratory system enables gas exchange, where oxygen is inhaled into the lungs and carbon dioxide is exhaled. The diaphragm and intercostal muscles play a crucial role in creating pressure changes that facilitate breathing.
        </p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the balloon is securely attached to prevent air leakage.</li>
            <li>Handle the rubber sheet gently to avoid tearing it.</li>
            <li>Observe the model or diagram carefully to understand the arrangement of the respiratory organs.</li>
        </ul>
