        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To study the structure and functioning of the human circulatory system, including the human heart and associated blood vessels.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3D model of the human heart</li>
            <li>Diagrams of arteries, veins, and capillaries</li>
            <li>Stethoscope (optional for practical use)</li>
            <li>Textbook reference diagrams</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Observe the 3D model of the human heart carefully. Identify and label the four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle.</li>
            <li>Locate the major blood vessels connected to the heart: the aorta, pulmonary arteries, pulmonary veins, and the vena cava.</li>
            <li>Examine the valves of the heart, such as the tricuspid valve, bicuspid valve, pulmonary valve, and aortic valve, and understand their roles in preventing backflow of blood.</li>
            <li>Study diagrams of arteries, veins, and capillaries to understand their structure and function:
                <ul>
                    <li>Arteries: Thick-walled vessels that carry oxygenated blood away from the heart.</li>
                    <li>Veins: Thin-walled vessels that return deoxygenated blood to the heart.</li>
                    <li>Capillaries: Tiny blood vessels that facilitate the exchange of nutrients, gases, and waste products at the cellular level.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Optionally, use a stethoscope to listen to heartbeats and understand the concept of the cardiac cycle.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>
            The human heart has four chambers and is connected to a network of blood vessels:
            <ul>
                <li>The heart pumps blood through the pulmonary and systemic circulations.</li>
                <li>Arteries carry oxygenated blood from the heart to various body parts, while veins return deoxygenated blood to the heart.</li>
                <li>Capillaries connect arteries and veins and facilitate nutrient and gas exchange at the tissue level.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Inference</h2>
        <p>
            The human circulatory system is a double circulatory system:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pulmonary circulation:</strong> Carries blood from the heart to the lungs for oxygenation and back to the heart.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemic circulation:</strong> Delivers oxygenated blood from the heart to the rest of the body and returns deoxygenated blood to the heart.</li>
            </ul>
            This ensures efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery while removing waste products from the body.
        </p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle the 3D model carefully to avoid damage.</li>
            <li>Ensure the diagrams used for study are labeled accurately for better understanding.</li>
            <li>If using a stethoscope, sanitize it before and after use.</li>
        </ul>
