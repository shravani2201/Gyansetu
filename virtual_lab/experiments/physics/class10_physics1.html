        <h1>Class 10 Physics - Ohm's Law</h1>
    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To verify Ohm's law, which states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided the temperature remains constant.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Resistor (with known resistance)</li>
            <li>Ammeter (for measuring current)</li>
            <li>Voltmeter (for measuring voltage)</li>
            <li>Battery (with adjustable voltage, e.g., variable power supply)</li>
            <li>Connecting wires</li>
            <li>Rheostat (optional, to vary current)</li>
            <li>Switch</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Set up the circuit by connecting the resistor, ammeter, and voltmeter in series and parallel as required. Ensure that the battery and switch are correctly placed for controlling the circuit.</li>
            <li>Turn on the power and measure the voltage across the resistor using the voltmeter and the current passing through the resistor using the ammeter. Record these values.</li>
            <li>Vary the voltage by adjusting the battery or using a rheostat to change the current. For each change in voltage, measure the corresponding current through the resistor.</li>
            <li>Repeat the measurements for at least five different voltage values.</li>
            <li>Plot a graph of voltage (Y-axis) vs. current (X-axis). The resulting graph should be a straight line through the origin if Ohm's law holds true.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>The graph of voltage vs. current is a straight line, indicating that the current is directly proportional to the voltage. This confirms Ohmâ€™s law, where the resistance (R) remains constant and the ratio of voltage to current (V/I) equals the resistance.</p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the ammeter and voltmeter are connected correctly in the circuit: the ammeter in series and the voltmeter in parallel with the resistor.</li>
            <li>Use a variable power supply or rheostat to gradually change the voltage, preventing sudden surges in current.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the resistor does not overheat, as it could affect the results by changing its resistance with temperature.</li>
            <li>Take accurate readings from the ammeter and voltmeter, noting their units.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>The experiment verifies Ohm's law, which states that the current through a conductor is directly proportional to the voltage across it, provided the temperature is constant. This is observed in the straight-line graph plotted between voltage and current.</p>
