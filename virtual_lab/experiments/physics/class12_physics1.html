    </header>
    <main>
        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To demonstrate electromagnetic induction and understand the principles behind the generation of electric current through the relative motion between a magnetic field and a coil. This experiment will help visualize how changing magnetic flux through a coil induces a current, following Faraday's law of induction.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Solenoid coil (a coil of wire)</li>
            <li>Bar magnet (a strong permanent magnet)</li>
            <li>Galvanometer (to detect the induced current)</li>
            <li>Connecting wires (for electrical connections)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the galvanometer to the solenoid coil using the connecting wires.</li>
            <li>Hold the bar magnet and move it rapidly through the solenoid coil in one direction.</li>
            <li>Observe the deflection in the galvanometer. The presence of a deflection indicates the presence of an induced current due to the motion of the magnet through the coil.</li>
            <li>Now, reverse the motion of the magnet (move it in the opposite direction through the coil) and observe the change in the galvanometer’s deflection. The direction of the induced current should reverse as well.</li>
            <li>For further verification, vary the speed of motion of the magnet and note the corresponding change in the galvanometer's deflection. A faster movement of the magnet should induce a larger current.</li>
            <li>Try changing the number of turns of the solenoid coil or the strength of the magnet to observe how these factors affect the induced current.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>When the magnet moves through the solenoid coil, the galvanometer shows a deflection, indicating the generation of an induced current. The direction of the current depends on the direction of the magnet’s motion. A faster motion results in a larger deflection, indicating a stronger induced current. This demonstrates the principle of electromagnetic induction, where a changing magnetic flux through the coil induces an electromotive force (EMF).</p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the magnet is moved quickly through the coil for a noticeable deflection in the galvanometer.</li>
            <li>Use a strong bar magnet to induce a sufficient current for measurement.</li>
            <li>Ensure all connections are secure to avoid any discrepancies in the results.</li>
            <li>Keep the solenoid coil steady and avoid any external movement that might affect the experiment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This experiment successfully demonstrates electromagnetic induction, where the motion of a bar magnet through a solenoid coil induces an electric current. The magnitude and direction of the induced current depend on the speed and direction of the magnet's motion, as well as the strength of the magnet and the number of turns in the coil. This is in accordance with Faraday's law of induction.</p>
