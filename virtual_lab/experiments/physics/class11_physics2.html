        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To verify the relationship between gravitational force and mass, and to understand how the gravitational force between two masses depends on their masses and the distance between them, in accordance with Newton's law of gravitation.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Spring balance (for measuring the force of gravity)</li>
            <li>Metal spheres (of different masses)</li>
            <li>Stand (for supporting the spheres at a fixed distance)</li>
            <li>Measuring tape (for measuring the distance between the spheres)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Measure the weight of two metal spheres of different masses using the spring balance.</li>
            <li>Place the spheres at different distances from each other and record the force exerted by the spheres on each other, as measured by the spring balance.</li>
            <li>Repeat the measurements at different distances and record the corresponding values of gravitational force.</li>
            <li>Compare the experimental results with the theoretical values of gravitational force calculated using Newton’s law of gravitation: <i>F = G * (m₁ * m₂) / r²</i>, where F is the gravitational force, G is the gravitational constant, m₁ and m₂ are the masses of the two spheres, and r is the distance between them.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>The gravitational force between two masses is observed to be directly proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This confirms Newton’s law of gravitation. As the distance between the spheres increases, the force decreases.</p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the spheres are placed on the stand at the same height to avoid error in measurements.</li>
            <li>Make sure the spring balance is properly calibrated for accurate readings.</li>
            <li>Keep the environment free from air currents or other forces that might affect the measurements.</li>
            <li>Measure the distance between the spheres precisely to minimize errors in the experiment.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>This experiment successfully verifies the relationship between gravitational force and mass as described by Newton’s law of gravitation. The results confirm that the gravitational force is proportional to the product of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.</p>
