        <h2>Aim</h2>
        <p>To prepare oxygen gas by decomposing hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) using manganese dioxide (MnO₂) as a catalyst, and to observe the characteristics of oxygen gas.</p>

        <h2>Materials Required</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Hydrogen Peroxide (H₂O₂)</li>
            <li>Manganese Dioxide (MnO₂) (as a catalyst)</li>
            <li>Conical flask</li>
            <li>Delivery tube</li>
            <li>Water trough</li>
            <li>Glowing splint (for testing oxygen)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Take a clean conical flask and add a small amount of manganese dioxide (MnO₂) as a catalyst. Manganese dioxide will speed up the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide without being consumed in the reaction.</li>
            <li>Pour hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) into the flask. The hydrogen peroxide will start decomposing into water and oxygen gas when the catalyst is added.</li>
            <li>Immediately connect a delivery tube to the flask. The other end of the delivery tube should be immersed in a water trough to collect the evolved gas by upward displacement of water.</li>
            <li>Observe the bubbling and release of oxygen gas as the reaction proceeds. The reaction is exothermic, and oxygen is released as a result of the decomposition.</li>
            <li>Collect the oxygen gas in the inverted jar submerged in the water trough. The gas will displace the water, and the jar will fill with oxygen.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Observation</h2>
        <p>Oxygen gas is released during the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of manganese dioxide. The evolution of oxygen can be confirmed by testing it with a glowing splint. When a glowing splint is introduced into the jar filled with oxygen, it relights, confirming the presence of oxygen gas.</p>

        <h2>Reaction Equation</h2>
        <p>The decomposition reaction of hydrogen peroxide is as follows:</p>
        <p><code>2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂↑</code></p>
        <p>The manganese dioxide (MnO₂) acts as a catalyst, speeding up the reaction without being consumed in the process.</p>

        <h2>Precautions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Handle hydrogen peroxide carefully, as it is a strong oxidizing agent and can cause burns or irritations.</li>
            <li>Ensure the conical flask is clean to avoid contamination of the chemicals.</li>
            <li>Use a properly fitted delivery tube to prevent the escape of gas and to direct it into the water trough.</li>
            <li>Always check the setup for leaks before starting the experiment to ensure efficient gas collection.</li>
        </ul>
